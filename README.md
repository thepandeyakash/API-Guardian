## 📖 Overview

API Guardian is a full-stack observability and security platform designed to help developers monitor API availability, detect incidents, analyze performance trends, and identify security vulnerabilities.

The platform performs automated API health checks and security scans, stores historical analytics, generates incident reports, and leverages AI to explain security vulnerabilities and recommend fixes.

This project was built as a production-style SaaS application with asynchronous workers, real-time analytics dashboards, security auditing, and AI-assisted remediation.
